# 12Screen
A screentime removal tool for iOS 12.



## Usage

Please make sure you have the ```sqlite3``` package installed on the iPhone prior to running this tool.

Open a SSH tunnel to your phone at ```127.0.0.1:22```. I like to do this using [3uTools](https://www.3u.com/), which is available to download for free.

Open up a terminal, and run ```12Screen.exe```. The tool will guide you through usage.
